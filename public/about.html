      <h2>Interactive Chromatic Harmonica Visualization Tool</h2>
      <p>
        This application is dedicated to chromatic harmonicas and its enthusiasts. It provides an interactive, visual representation of a 16-hole chromatic harmonica. Each hole displays four notes that correspond to the blow with the slide in, blow, draw, and draw with the slide in positions. The notes for all 16 holes are clearly shown to enhance understanding and usability.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key features of this application is the ability to select a scale (major, minor, or pentatonic) or a chord in the scale. Upon selection, the relevant notes on the harmonica are highlighted, making it easier for users to identify the notes corresponding to the chosen scale or chord. To provide an accurate and comprehensive representation, the application takes into account the equivalency of certain musical notes, such as B# and C, and E# and F. This consideration ensures that users are presented with all relevant notes, even those that may not be immediately apparent.

        The Chromatic Harmonica Visualization application is a result of a collaborative effort between <a href=https://shrichris.github.io.>Sri</a> and ChatGPT/GPT4, combining their expertise to create an engaging and informative tool for harmonica enthusiasts and musicians alike. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We acknowledge that there are areas for improvement and corrections, and we plan to address them in due time, ensuring the application continues to provide an accurate and valuable resource for users.
